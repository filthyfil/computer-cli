# Computer CLI
## What's this?
**Computer** is a personal command-line assistant that lets you run Python code, evaluate math expressions, and interact with tools via natural language prompts.

Think of it like “talking to a calculator and mini-agent” directly from your terminal:

```bash
computer what is 1+1
computer whats the integral of x^3
computer does 1=3?
```

## Features
 - (Usually) evaluates math expressions using sympy
 - Run arbitrary Python one-liners through your CLI
 - Practically limited to the sandbox directory to write scripts. Certain libraries are off limits.
 - Provides safety checks for shell commands and python scripts
 - Supports tools (Read, Write, Bash, Confusion)

## How do I use this?
See `USERGUIDE.md` for installation and usage.

## But why?
Because having a calculator for unstructured inputs thats super easy to interact with is useful.
